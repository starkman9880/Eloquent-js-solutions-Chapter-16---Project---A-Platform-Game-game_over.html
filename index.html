1 - Game Over (8/4/2022)
Itâ€™s traditional for platform games to have the player start with a limited number of lives and subtract one life each time they die. When the player is out of lives, the game restarts from the beginning.
Adjust `runGame` to implement lives. Have the player start with three. Output the current number of lives (using `console.log`) every time a level starts.
